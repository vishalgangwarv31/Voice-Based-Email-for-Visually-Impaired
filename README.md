**Open-Source Voice Based Emailing System for Visually Impaired.**
  
## About

[This project](https://github.com/Dikshabisht7/Voice-Based-Email-for-Visually-Impaired/blob/main/voice_based_mail_for_visually_impaired.ipynb) is a `python-based` application that uses speech to text voice response to enable visually impaired people to manage their email accounts with their voice
alone, as well as read, send, and perform all other useful tasks. The system will prompt voice commands to the user to perform a specific action, and the user will 
respond accordingly. The main advantage of this project is that it eliminates the use of a mouse; instead, the user will have to respond through voice only.
